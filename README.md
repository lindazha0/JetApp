# jetapp

A simple web app using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). The `jetApp` program contains functionalies like face recogenition and management, TTS, image playing, and identity authentification, and deployed on an `jetbot` based on [Nvidia Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano).    

## Overview
- Baidu and Tencent APIs are used for face dataset management and TTS functionalities.
- `Tracking` for face recogenition
- CSS and JS files implements the styles, layouts and image display, etc.

Due to the some Confidentiality Agreements, only an original version is displayed here for learning and referring since more advanced version is not released. As for language, the frontend uses purely `html/css+js` and the backend uses `java`. BTW, the backend uses a framework based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), which is not shown here.
