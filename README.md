# jetapp

A simple web app using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). The `jetApp` program contains functionalies like face recogenition and management, TTS, image playing, and identity authentification, and deployed on an `jetbot` based on [Nvidia Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano).    
Due to the some Confidentiality Agreements, only an original version is displayed here for learning and referring since more advanced version is not released. BTW, the backend uses a framework based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), which is not shown here.
